2       |   python_scripts          |   python scripts for samples make, QMDCT extraction and so on
3       |   secret_message          |   secret message file for embedding
4       |   BatchRename.exe         |   an *.exe for file rename in batch

### Procedure of data processing
1. samples making
2. samples check (bitrate, file size, embedding rate)
3. QMDCT extraction
4. train and test split
5. [feature extraction](https://github.com/Charleswyt/audio_steganalysis_ml/tree/master/feature_extract)
6. SVM train, validation and test
7. record the results
