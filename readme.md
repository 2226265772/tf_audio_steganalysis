Hope we can have a friendly communication.

This project is a tensorflow implementation of recent work, you can also design your own network via this platform.

## Necessary Package
tensorflow-gpu==1.4 or later, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-image, scikit-learn, librosa (depend on **FFmpeg**)

You can use command **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install all packages mentioned above. If you don't want to change your version of tensorflow, you can use **virtualenv** to create a new python run environment.

## How to use
1. install [**python3.x**](https://www.python.org/) or [**Anaconda**](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/) and add the path into the environment variable
2. **GPU** run environment [**configure**](https://blog.csdn.net/yhaolpz/article/details/71375762?locationNum=14&fps=1) if train the network (optional)
3. install all dependent packages mentioned above (open **[setup](https://github.com/Charleswyt/tf_audio_steganalysis/tree/master/setup)/requirements.txt** and input "**pip install -r requirements**" into your cmd window)
4. **run** the code as the [**example**](https://github.com/Charleswyt/tf_audio_steganalysis/tree/master/config_file) as follows
5. use **tensorboard** to visualize the train process such as the accuracy and loss curve of train and valid. The command is "**tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/log-directory**"
